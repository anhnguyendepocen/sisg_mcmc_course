# SISG_MCMC_COURSE

This repository includes the LaTeX source code and the image files
to produce the lectures used by Eric C. Anderson and Matthew Stephens
in their course "Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Statistical Genetics" taught
at the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics (SISG).  

These lecture notes were originally written by Eric C. Anderson and Mike
Denham in the spring of 2004 for the SISG that was taught that year
at North Carolina State University.  The pair taught the same course
in 2005.  After that, Matthew Stephens took over Mike Denham's part of the
course, adding lectures and rewriting significant portions of others.

We are grateful to Mike Denham for providing the style files for formatting
the lectures. These files begin with "mcd".

This repository was initialized on GitHub in 2014.  It does not include the
revision history over the previous 5 years (when it was under version control with
subversion).
