{\color{section0}Dr Eric C. Anderson\\
NOAA - Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Santa Cruz, CA\\
Research Associate, Department of Applied Math \& Statistics, UCSC}

Eric develops methods for the analysis of genetic data from populations of salmon and other organisms.  He has developed approaches using MCMC and other Monte Carlo methods for estimating $N_e$, classifying species hybrids, the inference of pedigrees, and analysis of massively parallel sequencing data.

{\color{section0}Dr Matthew Stephens\\
Professor, Department of Human Genetics and\\
Department of Statistics, The University of Chicago}
  
Matthew develops methods for the analysis of genetic data in humans and other species. He has, among other applications, developed MCMC methods to estimate population structure, rates of recombination, missing genotypes, and haplotype phase from genotypes on unrelated individuals.
